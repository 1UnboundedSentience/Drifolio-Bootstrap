For them it could be a great template that needs one time setup.\r\n\r\nYou just need to set your info and dribbble username, that's all. And after that, whenever you post something on dribbble, it'll come automatically to your website as well. There's nothing to do there again :)\r\n\r\nLive demo: http://creatrix.us/demo/drifolio/\r\n\r\nView the post on dribbble: http://drbl.in/mVHv\r\n\r\nAlso available on ShapeBootstrap:\r\nhttp://shapebootstrap.net/item/drifolio-free-responsive-dribbble-portfolio-template/\r\n\r\nThis is a free Bootstrap powered HTML template from EvenFly.
